# Books API Week 02 Spec - Version 2

## Feature 1: Book CRUD Operations and Author References

### Goal
Update the existing Week 01 book API so book documents include a reference to an author and the API supports all CRUD operations for books. Every book route must be documented and testable in Swagger.

### Data Model
Book documents will be stored in the `books` collection.

Required book fields:
- `id`: string, required, custom id such as `b1`
- `authorId`: string, required, references the `id` field of an author document
- `title`: string, required
- `publicationDate`: string, required

Books will continue to use custom string ids instead of MongoDB `_id` values for route parameters.

### Relationship to Authors
Each book will identify its author with an `authorId` field. The value of `authorId` must match the custom `id` value of an existing author document.

When creating or updating a book, the API should reject the request with a `400` status code if the submitted `authorId` does not match an existing author.

### Routes

#### GET /books
Purpose: Return all books.

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: an array of book objects

Errors:
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs — `{ "message": "Internal server error" }`

#### GET /books/:id
Purpose: Return one book by its custom id.

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the matching book object

Errors:
- `404` if no book exists with that id — `{ "message": "Book not found" }`
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs — `{ "message": "Internal server error" }`

#### POST /books
Purpose: Create a new book.

Request body:

    {
      "id": "b4",
      "authorId": "a1",
      "title": "Example Book Title",
      "publicationDate": "2026-01-15"
    }

Success:
- Status code: `201`
- Response body: the newly created book object

Errors:
- `400` if a required field is missing — `{ "message": "id, authorId, title, and publicationDate are required" }`
- `400` if the `id` already exists — `{ "message": "Book already exists" }`
- `400` if the `authorId` does not match an existing author — `{ "message": "Author not found" }`
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs — `{ "message": "Internal server error" }`

#### PUT /books/:id
Purpose: Update an existing book. The `id` comes from the URL path; the body contains only the fields to update.

Request body:

    {
      "authorId": "a2",
      "title": "Updated Book Title",
      "publicationDate": "2026-02-20"
    }

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the updated book object

Errors:
- `400` if a required field is missing — `{ "message": "authorId, title, and publicationDate are required" }`
- `400` if the `authorId` does not match an existing author — `{ "message": "Author not found" }`
- `404` if no book exists with that id — `{ "message": "Book not found" }`
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs — `{ "message": "Internal server error" }`

#### DELETE /books/:id
Purpose: Delete an existing book.

Success:
- Status code: `204`
- Response body: none

Errors:
- `404` if no book exists with that id — `{ "message": "Book not found" }`
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs — `{ "message": "Internal server error" }`

### Swagger Documentation
Swagger must document every book route.

### Deployment Expectations
After implementation, the book routes must work locally and from the deployed Render application. The deployed Swagger page at `/api-docs` must allow someone to test every book route from the browser.

## Feature 2: Author CRUD Operations

### Goal
Add an `authors` collection that stores author documents and provide a complete set of CRUD routes for authors. Every author route must be documented and testable in Swagger.

### Data Model
Author documents will be stored in the `authors` collection.

Required author fields:
- `id`: string, required, custom id such as `a1`
- `name`: string, required
- `birthYear`: integer, required

Authors will use custom string ids instead of MongoDB `_id` values for route parameters.

### Routes

#### GET /authors
Purpose: Return all authors.

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: an array of author objects

Errors:
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs — `{ "message": "Internal server error" }`

#### GET /authors/:id
Purpose: Return one author by their custom id.

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the matching author object

Errors:
- `404` if no author exists with that id — `{ "message": "Author not found" }`
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs — `{ "message": "Internal server error" }`

#### POST /authors
Purpose: Create a new author.

Request body:

    {
      "id": "a4",
      "name": "Example Author",
      "birthYear": 1980
    }

Success:
- Status code: `201`
- Response body: the newly created author object

Errors:
- `400` if a required field is missing — `{ "message": "id, name, and birthYear are required" }`
- `400` if the `id` already exists — `{ "message": "Author already exists" }`
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs — `{ "message": "Internal server error" }`

#### PUT /authors/:id
Purpose: Update an existing author. The `id` comes from the URL path; the body contains only the fields to update.

Request body:

    {
      "name": "Updated Author",
      "birthYear": 1981
    }

Success:
- Status code: `200`
- Response body: the updated author object

Errors:
- `400` if a required field is missing — `{ "message": "name and birthYear are required" }`
- `404` if no author exists with that id — `{ "message": "Author not found" }`
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs — `{ "message": "Internal server error" }`

#### DELETE /authors/:id
Purpose: Delete an existing author.

Success:
- Status code: `204`
- Response body: none

Errors:
- `404` if no author exists with that id — `{ "message": "Author not found" }`
- `409` if the author still has books — `{ "message": "Author still has books" }`
- `500` if an unexpected server or database error occurs — `{ "message": "Internal server error" }`

### Deleting an author who still has books
If a client attempts to `DELETE /authors/:id` and one or more book documents reference that author via `authorId`, the API returns `409 Conflict` with the response body `{ "message": "Author still has books" }`. The author is not deleted. This prevents orphaned `authorId` values in the books collection.

### Swagger Documentation
Swagger must document every author route.

### Deployment Expectations
After implementation, the author routes must work locally and from the deployed Render application. The deployed Swagger page at `/api-docs` must allow someone to test every author route from the browser.
